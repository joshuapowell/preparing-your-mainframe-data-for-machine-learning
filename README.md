# Mainframe Data Wrangling: Preparing Your Data for Use in Machine Learning Models

Mainframe computing continues to drive the global economy, with
forty-five of the world's top fifty banks \[1\] handling critical
transaction data through the IBM Z mainframe platform. While recent
research highlights the importance of mainframe modernization rather
than replacement \[2\], enterprises struggle to effectively utilize
mainframe data for automation and optimization due to data-driven and
communication-driven failures \[3\]. This challenge creates a
significant gap between available mainframe capabilities and realized
business value \[4\].

To address this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with
eighteen participants across three roles: mainframe subject matter
experts (SME) \[n=6\], mainframe individual contributor end-users
\[n=9\], and mainframe people manager end-users \[n=3\]. The study,
conducted between \[dates\], investigated two research questions:
\[RQ1\] What are the primary use cases in which mainframe network and
network security data impacts mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR) in top
fifty banks? And \[RQ2\] What mainframe data sources and methods do
end-users employ to resolve these network and network security issues?

Analysis revealed that 91% of participants \[5\] encountered data
quality or completeness issues that impeded network problem resolution.
This tutorial demonstrates how end-users can leverage exploratory data
analysis techniques \[6\], mainframe data APIs \[7\], and open source
data science tools \[8\] to prepare data for advanced analytics and
machine learning applications. The presented methodology aims to reduce
MTTR by addressing identified data-driven and communication-driven
failure points \[9\], with specific focus on network security use cases
\[10-13\].
